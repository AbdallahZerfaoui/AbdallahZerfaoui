Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently turning **applied mathematics** into real-world solutionsâ€”whether itâ€™s crunching numbers or simulating complex systems.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m honing my **C**, **C++**, and **Python** skills to tackle any challenge that needs a solid calculation approach.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where **problem-solving** is key: from algorithm optimization to high-performance computing.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m ready to jump into any domain that demands analytical thinking, from mechanical engineering to pure data science.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about diving deep into **matrices**, speeding up **numerical methods**, or the best way to handle **high-performance** code.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: If thereâ€™s a problem that needs maths, Iâ€™ll be thereâ€”debugging and iterating until itâ€™s solved!
